				You can obtain all attunement beside Light by collect ingredients to make them into potion and drinking them to obtain the qualification to use those magic. Trainer helps you level up your spell from level 1 to 5 and the price of each level of spell cost 100 notes and increase addtional 100 notes on every upcomming level.</p>

			<h2>How to get out of Depth or return to your regional world.</h2>
				<h3>There are two process in getting out of the depth.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Step 1 you need to look for ways to enter the trail room.</li>
				<li> Step 2 is to defeated the given trail.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are two way to get trail room. The first one is the build a barrel ladder up to the top of the wall inorder to enter the castle. Another way is to enter the city called "city of drowned" head to the center where there is a gate. The gate will open or close depend on your luck in the server, however you can leave and join back the game to look for a open gate.
			The trail contain five type of NPC mob which include regular soldier, angle, sharko, corrupted sharko, and enforcer. Trail can be done with multiple player at once, however
			the difficulty will also increase. Which it is recommended to do the trail yourself.</p> 
			<ul>
				<p>Trail NPC will be match with player with certain level plus luck.</p>
				<li>Level 1 to 10</li>
				<p>You will get a free trail pass which you get to leave without encountering a NPC match</p>
				<li>Level 10 to 15</li>
				<p>Will encounter regular NPC with a sword that does basic m1 and R attack with parry.</p>
				<li>Level 15 to 20</li>
				<p>Will encounter angle that has same move set as regular NPC, but with one addtional unqiue skill that shoot 3-4 projectile.</p>
				<li>Level 20 to 40</li>
				<p>Will encounter regular sharko or corrupted sharko depend on your luck.</p>
				<li>Level 40 or Higher </li>
				<p>Will encounter Enforcer. To deal with enforcer you need to master their attack pattern and learn to parry.</p>
			</ul>
			<p>If you can't beat the trail your character will be wipe and you need to start over from level 1.</p>
