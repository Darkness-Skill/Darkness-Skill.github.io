Which very few player in this game has it and the chance of meeting one is consider rare, which is why there are very little information about this attunement at this point.
				You can obtain all attunement beside Light by collect ingredients to make them into potion and drinking them to obtain the qualification to use those magic. Trainer helps you level up your spell from level 1 to 5 and the price of each level of spell cost 100 notes and increase addtional 100 notes on every upcomming level.</p>
